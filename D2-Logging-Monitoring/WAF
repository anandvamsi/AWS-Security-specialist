WAF
------------
AWS WAF is a web application firewall.

Lets you moniotr HTTP and HTTPs requests that are forwarded to an API GW, Amazon CF and ALB
Allows you to control access to your content by using IP address from where  the request orginated or request query stirng values.
If the request is allow it provides the access, else it will provide 403 status code forbidden access.
3 things make WAF work:- ACL, rules, and Rule Groups.
AWS WAF includes a full-featured API that you can use to automated the creation, deployment and maintaince of security rules.
AWS manages WebACL capacity units(WCU) for rules, rule groups and web ACLs
WCU is a dimention that is used to calculate and contril the operating resouces that are used to rpcoess rules within a web ACL.
Note:- WCU does not reprsent a rule for pricing consideration.

Web ACLs
- 



WebACLRules
There are two different types of rules
- Managed rules
- custom rules

Below are example of custom rules

    Based on the GEO location  
         more like restrict data other than this country

    Based on the query string 
         if there is any query string in the URL, we can block it
         www.abc.cin?admin  :- where admin is the query string


Below are examples of Managed ruled groups
- 
PHP application
posix OS
SQL database
      url/products?category=course'+OR+1=1--'

windows OS
wordpress application
Linux OS


online CURL :- google it
where we can mention from which country we can access the data.



Creation of WAF
- First select the region
- select the  Resource type
    - cloudfront
    - regional resources :- ALB,API gateway, AWS app sync


Custom response bodies
------------------------
we can write custom text that indicates/show whenever there is an error it notifies.


Implemenation notes:-
First implement WAF dev/stage level if its working good replicate the same in production
Applicaton security should be involved while implementing WAF

Pricing Details:-
AWS WAF charges based on the number of Web ACLs that you create , the number of rules that you can add per Web ACL, and numner web requests that you can 
receive
