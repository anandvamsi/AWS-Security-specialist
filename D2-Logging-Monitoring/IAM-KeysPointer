Pointer 2:-
Disabling the IAM creds are better than deleting the creds


Activity 
----------
Create and IAM configure key in a server
TO generate a temp key from the Access key and secret key use the command
#aws sts get-session-token 
which will generate temp Access key ,secret key and session 
Note:- these keys do have an expiration 

Use above information to config 
aws_access_key=
aws_secret_key=
aws_session_token= 
configure the same in the ~/.aws/config

Note if the attack happens , we generally delete/inactive the orginal key , But still the temp keys will works


How to solve solve this issue then:-
Method-1 :- Either remove all the polices of that IAM user/role
Method-2: Add Explict deny policy to the exiting policy
    - Effect deny
        Actions *
        Resources *

Temp Creds which we created stays for 15-36 hrs

Pointer 4
--------------
Because access_key were delete delete/disable in previous step,
- Consdider Creating a new pair of access/secret key
- Instead of using lon ter, keys, consider using IAM roles or federatin
