CloudTraill
----------------
Lets monitor every thing
Usecase::- Installing video survillance systems allow us to monitor activies around the clock and privdes alot of benefits
- Deterring Criminals
- Helps in invetingation
- Regular monioting of activies

AWS cloudtrail is now enabled by default  for all the customers and provide visibility of account acitivity without the need for you to configure
a trail in the service to get started.
Events are not stored for life time.
Inorder to save the logs for more time and do analytics, we are creating a new trail which will send logs to cloudwatch-logs/s3 bucket

There are 3 typles of events that can be logged in cloudtrails
1. Management events::- default option
2. Data events
3. Insight events

Management events:
Create  a new ec2 server , creates a new IAM user, user Sign-ins

Data events
Data events provide information aout the resourse operatons performed on or in a resource and are often high volumne activities
S3 get object, putobject and Delete object 

Insight events
Insight events helps customers unusual operations activity in the aws accounts, such as spike in resource provisioning , burst of IAM actions
more use for finding out unsual patterns
API-call rate
API-rate event.


Cloudtrail-log file intergrity 
----------------------------
This can check if the  cloudtrail in the s3 is tampered or not by the attacker , by default Integrity is enabled in the trail level.
if you want to check the integrity of the files, we need use the cli
aws cloudtrail describe-trails
aws cloudtrail validate-logs --trail-arn [ARN-HERE] --start-time 20190101T19:00:00Z

Note:- if you intentionally delete a s3 log file, and execute the above command, it will say that integrrity has been lost
