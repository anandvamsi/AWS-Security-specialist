what happens if EBS in encrypted with CMK and that CMK is deleted.
EBS will work, till it is not unmounted :- Back up data quickly


A user having full access to EC2 cannot start EC2 instances that is using encyrpted EBS volumes.
In order to overcome this Scenario, Following are two important policy actions must be attached
KMS:Decrypt
KMS:CreateGrant

How does EBS encrytion works?
EBS uses a datakey derived from a CML to encrypt data as it get stored on-disk. EBS stores the data key in its volume metadata.
When the EBS is detached from an instance, the data key inside its metadata remains in the encrypted form.
Once it is attached state, EBS uses your CMK to decrypt teh encrypted data key. The resulting data key in plaintext form is persisted in the hypervisor memory.
