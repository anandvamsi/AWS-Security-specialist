Elastic Load Balancer
--------------------
ALB can be intergrated with WAF for the Layer7 protection.
if applicaton is running a customer proprietry protocool than HTTP/HTTPS listeners cannot be used, Make use if TCP based listeners.
ELB supports Perfect forward Secrecy and we need to enable ECDHE key exchange.


"perfect Forward Secrecy" is a feture that provides addition safeguard against the evesdropping of encrypted data, through use of unique random session key.
This prevents the decoding of captured data, even if "secret long term" key is compromised.
