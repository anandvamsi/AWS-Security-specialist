KMS(Key Management service)
Is a managed service that enables you to easly encrypt your data.
KMS provides HA key storage,Management and auditing solution for you to encrypt data within
your own applications

Features:-
  - KMS is integrated with CloudTrail, which provides you that ability to audit who used which
  keys, on which resources and when
  - CMK(Customer Managed Keys) are used control access to data encyption keys and decryption
  - we have option to Automatically rotate KMS Master keys without the need to re-encypt data that
  already been encrypted your master key.
  - To sure HA, KMS store multiple versions od the keys
  
  
  CMK is a regional service, to use in different region decrypt the data from the source CMK and re-encrypte it withe CMK in the destination region

Data Encryption keys can be used for encrypting large amounts of data


Amazon Manage CMKs
Created ,Managed are used on behlaf by an AWS srevice that is intergrated with AWS KMS.
you cannot manage these CMKs, rotate them or change their key policies.
You also cannot use AWS Managed CMKs in cryptographic operations directly; the 

Data Encryption Keys
