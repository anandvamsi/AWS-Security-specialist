Encryption in transit
------------------------
Amazon S3 permits HTTP and HTTPS request by default(as you all know HTTP is insure)
In order to protect the data in the transit we need use the conditional block  "aws:SecureTransport" to True.(This bucket policy will only allow HTTPS request to all objects inside
examplebucket. All HTTP request will be denied.

Usin the VPC endpoints we can privately connect VPC to Amazon s3.
