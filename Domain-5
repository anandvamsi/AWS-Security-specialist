#ACM
AWS certificate Manager
- Certificates in ACM are regional resources. To use Certificate with ELB you must issue certificate in the same region as ELB.
There are two ways in which certificate can be issued.
- Email validation
- DNS Validation

Certificae for the domain example.com will not work for test.example.com
we need to get a wildcard certificate *.example.com for the above.
