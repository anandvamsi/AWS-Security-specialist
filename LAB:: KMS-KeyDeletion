Deleting KMS is descrutive process and potentially dangerours and irresistible process.
After a KMS key is deleted, you longer can decyrpt the data which is already encrypted under that KMS key.
If you are not sure about the data better disable the key for some duration; you can re-enable the key which is in diabled state.
And if you pretty sure about KMS key ; Mark it for deletion 


#Before Disabling the key
aws kms encrypt --key-id "2cb864df-970c-44ef-86dc-10XXXXXX820d30" --plaintext fileb://mypassword_encrypted --region us-west-2

}

#Disbale the KMS key in the AWS console
aws kms encrypt --key-id "2cb864df-970c-44ef-86dc-1XXX20d30" --plaintext fileb://mypassword_encrypted --region us-west-2
