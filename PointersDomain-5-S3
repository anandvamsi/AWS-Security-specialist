If each object in s3 needs to be encypted with a unique key, than you can make use of multiple CMK.
if you want to encrypt data with CMK, make use of SSE-KMS

you can also create 2 Factor Authenticaton for decryption, for such use-case you can define a MFA policy with key policy.

if you want to enfore encryptin in transit, you can create a s3 bucket policy

"condition": {
  "Bool" :{
    "aws:SecureTransport": "true"
}
