If each object in s3 needs to be encypted with a unique key, than you can make use of multiple CMK.
if you want to encrypt data with CMK, make use of SSE-KMS

you can also create 2 Factor Authenticaton for decryption, for such use-case you can define a MFA policy with key policy.

if you want to enfore encryptin in transit, you can create a s3 bucket policy

"condition": {
  "Bool" :{
    "aws:SecureTransport": "true"
}


Within Server Side encryption there, 3 options can be used depending on the usecase.

Server Side Encryption with Amazon S3 Managed Keys(SS3-S3)
Server side Encryption  with CMK(Customer Master keys) stored in AWS kMS
server side Encryption with Customer provide Keys(SSE-C)
